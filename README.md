# 3D-To-2.5D
Simplify the 3D model mockups into 2.5D database

Actually my task is to simulate the mean radiant temperature of pedestrians. In order to do that, I have to calculate the surface temperature. I save my files step by step until the end of this project.

Key mision in this project: surface temperature (View factor), weather conditions (shortwave and longwave radiation), build the equivalent equation of buildings surfaces.

Since this project is the very beginning, I haven't put the vegetation effects and conductive heat transfer into my consideration.

Wish I can complete this project during my internship, God blessðŸ˜‚
